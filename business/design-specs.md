The "Vibe" & Design Direction
Concept: "Urban Kinetic." We are building a high-energy, premium streetwear brand. Think Nike meets Techwear.
Visual Style: Dark Mode preferred. Sleek, industrial, and high-contrast.
Primary Color: Matte Black / Dark Charcoal (Backgrounds).
Accent Color: "Chai Hai Teal" (Use for primary buttons and hover effects).
Typography:
Headlines: Big, Bold, Condensed Sans-Serif (e.g., Barlow Condensed or Oswald). ALL CAPS.
Body: Clean, minimal Sans-Serif (e.g., Inter).
Tech Specs: Monospaced font (e.g., Roboto Mono) for the anti-odor details.
2. The Core Message (Crucial for Copywriting)
The USP: Anti-Odor / Anti-Smell.
The Rule: DO NOT make it sound medical or hygienic. DO NOT use words like "Stinky feet" or "Bacteria."
The Angle: Focus on "Social Confidence," "24-Hour Freshness," and "Tech-Enabled Comfort."
Tagline to use: "SHOES OFF. CONFIDENCE ON." or "ENGINEERED FOR THE GRIND."
3. Page Structure & Layout Requirements
Hero Section: Full-screen width. High-impact image of the shoe or a model in motion. Headline must be massive: "DEFY THE HEAT."
Feature Breakdown (The Tech Section): A section dedicated to the "CH-Fresh Technology." Use a grid layout with icons to explain the features (Breathable, Odor-Lock, Moisture-Wicking) looking like a technical blueprint.
Product Carousel: Clean, floating shoe product shots. Minimalist "Add to Cart" buttons.
Lifestyle Section: A montage of photos showing the shoes in a Malaysian urban setting (coffee shops, street/road, parks).
Mobile Experience: The design must be Mobile-First. 80% of traffic will be on phones. Ensure buttons are thumb-friendly.
